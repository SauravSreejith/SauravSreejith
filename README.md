# Hi I am Saurav Sreejith
I'm an upcoming software engineer with a strong curiosity for how things work under the hood. My interests lie at the intersection of software development, cybersecurity, and operating systems. I‚Äôm also passionate about ethical hacking and hands-on security tools, and I love exploring low-level systems and Linux internals.

Currently, I‚Äôm diving deeper into real-world applications of cybersecurity, system architecture, and AI integration ‚Äî and always looking to learn more.

üõ†Ô∏è Always tinkering. Always learning. Always curious.
